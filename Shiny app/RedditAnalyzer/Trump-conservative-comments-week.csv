3) With the DOJ memo about ""not indicting a sitting president"" and the scope of investigations that have been done so far, how accurate to you feel both sides ""facts"" and talking points are?

4) Do you believe it is appropriate for conservatives in the Senate to state and follow through coordinating with the WH on the Senate Trial? Why or why not?

5) Do you have any concerns that something may become precedent with any possible out come of this impeachment? If so what is your concern(s) over and how could that effect future Presidents?

6) How does the list of individuals associated with Trump's campaign and office that have been charged and convinced of felony offence effect your perspective if at all?

6) How does the list of individuals associated with Trump's campaign and office that have been charged and convinced of felony offence effect your perspective if at all?

My attempt at these questions is to maintain as politically neutral as possible. I know we may disagree on many issues but I am of the opinion that regaurdless of how we came to the point in time we are at, the gravity of the matter necessitates deep critical thought to adress. Not just partisan sound bites and political echo chambers.

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to answer my questions to help me develop my own opinion. I hope this leads to more questions for myself down the road to research.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ebc0df/questions_on_impeachment/","self.Conservative","http://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ebc0df/questions_on_impeachment/?ref=search_posts"

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election.

Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified.

There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction).

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

Cruzs Take:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

I don't think Horowitz deserves as much flak as he is getting from conservatives. He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction). Also keep in mind his investigation is focused purely on FISA abuse in the Crossfire Investigation. He found the abuse.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it.

Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane.

There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

Cruzs Take:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

Cruzs Take:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

I don't think Horowitz deserves as much flak as he is getting from conservatives. He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction). Also keep in mind his investigation is focused purely on FISA abuse in the Crossfire Investigation. He found the abuse.

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

Cruzs Take:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

I don't think Horowitz deserves as much flak as he is getting from conservatives. He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction).

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation.

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

I don't think Horowitz deserves as much flak as he is getting from conservatives. He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction).

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

I don't think Horowitz deserves as much flak as he is getting from conservatives. He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction).

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

Cruzs Take:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

I don't think Horowitz deserves as much flak as he is getting from conservatives. He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction).

We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

Cruzs Take:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

I don't think Horowitz deserves as much flak as he is getting from conservatives. He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction).

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction.

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

Cruzs Take:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

I don't think Horowitz deserves as much flak as he is getting from conservatives. He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction).

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating.

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

Cruzs Take:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

I don't think Horowitz deserves as much flak as he is getting from conservatives. He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction).

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

I don't think Horowitz deserves as much flak as he is getting from conservatives. He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction).

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

Cruzs Take:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

I don't think Horowitz deserves as much flak as he is getting from conservatives. He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction).

Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction).

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction.

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

Cruzs Take:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

Cruzs Take:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

I don't think Horowitz deserves as much flak as he is getting from conservatives. He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction). Also keep in mind his investigation is focused purely on FISA abuse in the Crossfire Investigation. He found the abuse.

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Heres my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any counter intelligence operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass Defensive Briefing to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the Russian Collusion conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you dont even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldnt rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obamas watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rivals campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again sees no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core arent even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh Dsouza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesnt seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didnt completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didnt tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinsteins questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a friendly foreign source that fed into the FBIs investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

Cruzs Take:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite not a source to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that persons part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. Not spying the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these spy events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- This wasnt Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldnt matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldnt have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasnt a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

I don't think Horowitz deserves as much flak as he is getting from conservatives. He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction). Also keep in mind his investigation is focused purely on FISA abuse in the Crossfire Investigation. He found the abuse. It was not a criminal investigation into the FBI actors.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/e9c7as/ig_horowitz_senate_hearing/","self.Conservative","http://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/e9c7as/ig_horowitz_senate_hearing/?ref=search_posts"

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or deep state, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isnt going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only pass Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didnt need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it.

Anyone who spends more than an instant looking at these can see that these are a complete sham.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

1. **Abuse of Power**  Lets just begin with this specific point: Abuse of Power is not a crime.  Its an accusation, but its such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  Its actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, theyre attempting to make anything that they dont like about any future presidents actions an abuse of power.  Who decides what abuse of power is?  Since its not legally defined, its literally nothing more than the opposition partys definition of what counts.  But attempting to use this as a charge, Democrats are setting up every president moving forward under the constant cloud of impeachment.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

It is quite the shame that House Democrats are acting on such flimsy and indefensible attempts at charging the president, because instead of issuing false charges and letting them fail, which absolutely would have happened, they are offering charges which dont exist under the law, and are therefore undefinable.  If you were charged for committing a crime, but the prosecutor couldnt name an actual crime that could be found on the books, your case would be thrown out in a matter of minutes, and you would probably have a case to sue the prosecutor for false prosecution, and this is no different.

You dont have to be a Trump supporter to see that this is institutionalized railroading, and the consequences of even attempting them could be far reaching and dangerous to the country.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/e8xlli/reading_the_impeachment_charges_house_democrats/","self.Conservative","http://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/e8xlli/reading_the_impeachment_charges_house_democrats/?ref=search_posts"

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

1. **Abuse of Power**  Lets just begin with this specific point: Abuse of Power is not a crime.  Its an accusation, but its such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  Its actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, theyre attempting to make anything that they dont like about any future presidents actions an abuse of power.  Who decides what abuse of power is?  Since its not legally defined, its literally nothing more than the opposition partys definition of what counts.  But attempting to use this as a charge, Democrats are setting up every president moving forward under the constant cloud of impeachment.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

It is quite the shame that House Democrats are acting on such flimsy and indefensible attempts at charging the president, because instead of issuing false charges and letting them fail, which absolutely would have happened, they are offering charges which dont exist under the law, and are therefore undefinable.  If you were charged for committing a crime, but the prosecutor couldnt name an actual crime that could be found on the books, your case would be thrown out in a matter of minutes, and you would probably have a case to sue the prosecutor for false prosecution, and this is no different.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

1. **Abuse of Power**  Lets just begin with this specific point: Abuse of Power is not a crime.  Its an accusation, but its such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  Its actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, theyre attempting to make anything that they dont like about any future presidents actions an abuse of power.  Who decides what abuse of power is?  Since its not legally defined, its literally nothing more than the opposition partys definition of what counts.  But attempting to use this as a charge, Democrats are setting up every president moving forward under the constant cloud of impeachment.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

It is quite the shame that House Democrats are acting on such flimsy and indefensible attempts at charging the president, because instead of issuing false charges and letting them fail, which absolutely would have happened, they are offering charges which dont exist under the law, and are therefore undefinable.  If you were charged for committing a crime, but the prosecutor couldnt name an actual crime that could be found on the books, your case would be thrown out in a matter of minutes, and you would probably have a case to sue the prosecutor for false prosecution, and this is no different.

Anyone who spends more than an instant looking at these can see that these are a complete sham.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

1. **Abuse of Power**  Lets just begin with this specific point: Abuse of Power is not a crime.  Its an accusation, but its such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  Its actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, theyre attempting to make anything that they dont like about any future presidents actions an abuse of power.  Who decides what abuse of power is?  Since its not legally defined, its literally nothing more than the opposition partys definition of what counts.  But attempting to use this as a charge, Democrats are setting up every president moving forward under the constant cloud of impeachment.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

It is quite the shame that House Democrats are acting on such flimsy and indefensible attempts at charging the president, because instead of issuing false charges and letting them fail, which absolutely would have happened, they are offering charges which dont exist under the law, and are therefore undefinable.  If you were charged for committing a crime, but the prosecutor couldnt name an actual crime that could be found on the books, your case would be thrown out in a matter of minutes, and you would probably have a case to sue the prosecutor for false prosecution, and this is no different.

Anyone who spends more than an instant looking at these can see that these are a complete sham.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

1. **Abuse of Power**  Lets just begin with this specific point: Abuse of Power is not a crime.  Its an accusation, but its such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  Its actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, theyre attempting to make anything that they dont like about any future presidents actions an abuse of power.  Who decides what abuse of power is?  Since its not legally defined, its literally nothing more than the opposition partys definition of what counts.  But attempting to use this as a charge, Democrats are setting up every president moving forward under the constant cloud of impeachment.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

Anyone who spends more than an instant looking at these can see that these are a complete sham.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

1. **Abuse of Power**  Lets just begin with this specific point: Abuse of Power is not a crime.  Its an accusation, but its such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  Its actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, theyre attempting to make anything that they dont like about any future presidents actions an abuse of power.  Who decides what abuse of power is?  Since its not legally defined, its literally nothing more than the opposition partys definition of what counts.  But attempting to use this as a charge, Democrats are setting up every president moving forward under the constant cloud of impeachment.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

Anyone who spends more than an instant looking at these can see that these are a complete sham.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

1. **Abuse of Power**  Lets just begin with this specific point: Abuse of Power is not a crime.  Its an accusation, but its such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  Its actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, theyre attempting to make anything that they dont like about any future presidents actions an abuse of power.  Who decides what abuse of power is?  Since its not legally defined, its literally nothing more than the opposition partys definition of what counts.  But attempting to use this as a charge, Democrats are setting up every president moving forward under the constant cloud of impeachment.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.

Anyone who spends more than an instant looking at these can see that these are a complete sham.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

1. **Abuse of Power**  Lets just begin with this specific point: Abuse of Power is not a crime.  Its an accusation, but its such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  Its actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, theyre attempting to make anything that they dont like about any future presidents actions an abuse of power.  Who decides what abuse of power is?  Since its not legally defined, its literally nothing more than the opposition partys definition of what counts.  But attempting to use this as a charge, Democrats are setting up every president moving forward under the constant cloud of impeachment.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.

Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

It is quite the shame that House Democrats are acting on such flimsy and indefensible attempts at charging the president, because instead of issuing false charges and letting them fail, which absolutely would have happened, they are offering charges which dont exist under the law, and are therefore undefinable.  If you were charged for committing a crime, but the prosecutor couldnt name an actual crime that could be found on the books, your case would be thrown out in a matter of minutes, and you would probably have a case to sue the prosecutor for false prosecution, and this is no different.

Anyone who spends more than an instant looking at these can see that these are a complete sham.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

1. **Abuse of Power**  Lets just begin with this specific point: Abuse of Power is not a crime.  Its an accusation, but its such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  Its actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, theyre attempting to make anything that they dont like about any future presidents actions an abuse of power.  Who decides what abuse of power is?  Since its not legally defined, its literally nothing more than the opposition partys definition of what counts.  But attempting to use this as a charge, Democrats are setting up every president moving forward under the constant cloud of impeachment.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.

As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.

As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

It is quite the shame that House Democrats are acting on such flimsy and indefensible attempts at charging the president, because instead of issuing false charges and letting them fail, which absolutely would have happened, they are offering charges which dont exist under the law, and are therefore undefinable.  If you were charged for committing a crime, but the prosecutor couldnt name an actual crime that could be found on the books, your case would be thrown out in a matter of minutes, and you would probably have a case to sue the prosecutor for false prosecution, and this is no different.

Anyone who spends more than an instant looking at these can see that these are a complete sham.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

1. **Abuse of Power**  Lets just begin with this specific point: Abuse of Power is not a crime.  Its an accusation, but its such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  Its actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, theyre attempting to make anything that they dont like about any future presidents actions an abuse of power.  Who decides what abuse of power is?  Since its not legally defined, its literally nothing more than the opposition partys definition of what counts.  But attempting to use this as a charge, Democrats are setting up every president moving forward under the constant cloud of impeachment.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

It is quite the shame that House Democrats are acting on such flimsy and indefensible attempts at charging the president, because instead of issuing false charges and letting them fail, which absolutely would have happened, they are offering charges which dont exist under the law, and are therefore undefinable.  If you were charged for committing a crime, but the prosecutor couldnt name an actual crime that could be found on the books, your case would be thrown out in a matter of minutes, and you would probably have a case to sue the prosecutor for false prosecution, and this is no different.

Anyone who spends more than an instant looking at these can see that these are a complete sham.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

1. **Abuse of Power**  Lets just begin with this specific point: Abuse of Power is not a crime.  Its an accusation, but its such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  Its actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, theyre attempting to make anything that they dont like about any future presidents actions an abuse of power.  Who decides what abuse of power is?

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

It is quite the shame that House Democrats are acting on such flimsy and indefensible attempts at charging the president, because instead of issuing false charges and letting them fail, which absolutely would have happened, they are offering charges which dont exist under the law, and are therefore undefinable.  If you were charged for committing a crime, but the prosecutor couldnt name an actual crime that could be found on the books, your case would be thrown out in a matter of minutes, and you would probably have a case to sue the prosecutor for false prosecution, and this is no different.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

It is quite the shame that House Democrats are acting on such flimsy and indefensible attempts at charging the president, because instead of issuing false charges and letting them fail, which absolutely would have happened, they are offering charges which dont exist under the law, and are therefore undefinable.  If you were charged for committing a crime, but the prosecutor couldnt name an actual crime that could be found on the books, your case would be thrown out in a matter of minutes, and you would probably have a case to sue the prosecutor for false prosecution, and this is no different.

Anyone who spends more than an instant looking at these can see that these are a complete sham.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

It is quite the shame that House Democrats are acting on such flimsy and indefensible attempts at charging the president, because instead of issuing false charges and letting them fail, which absolutely would have happened, they are offering charges which dont exist under the law, and are therefore undefinable.  If you were charged for committing a crime, but the prosecutor couldnt name an actual crime that could be found on the books, your case would be thrown out in a matter of minutes, and you would probably have a case to sue the prosecutor for false prosecution, and this is no different.

Anyone who spends more than an instant looking at these can see that these are a complete sham.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

1. **Abuse of Power**  Lets just begin with this specific point: Abuse of Power is not a crime.  Its an accusation, but its such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.

It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  Its actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, theyre attempting to make anything that they dont like about any future presidents actions an abuse of power.  Who decides what abuse of power is?  Since its not legally defined, its literally nothing more than the opposition partys definition of what counts.  But attempting to use this as a charge, Democrats are setting up every president moving forward under the constant cloud of impeachment.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

It is quite the shame that House Democrats are acting on such flimsy and indefensible attempts at charging the president, because instead of issuing false charges and letting them fail, which absolutely would have happened, they are offering charges which dont exist under the law, and are therefore undefinable.  If you were charged for committing a crime, but the prosecutor couldnt name an actual crime that could be found on the books, your case would be thrown out in a matter of minutes, and you would probably have a case to sue the prosecutor for false prosecution, and this is no different.

Anyone who spends more than an instant looking at these can see that these are a complete sham.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

Its an accusation, but its such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  Its actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, theyre attempting to make anything that they dont like about any future presidents actions an abuse of power.  Who decides what abuse of power is?  Since its not legally defined, its literally nothing more than the opposition partys definition of what counts.  But attempting to use this as a charge, Democrats are setting up every president moving forward under the constant cloud of impeachment.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

It is quite the shame that House Democrats are acting on such flimsy and indefensible attempts at charging the president, because instead of issuing false charges and letting them fail, which absolutely would have happened, they are offering charges which dont exist under the law, and are therefore undefinable.  If you were charged for committing a crime, but the prosecutor couldnt name an actual crime that could be found on the books, your case would be thrown out in a matter of minutes, and you would probably have a case to sue the prosecutor for false prosecution, and this is no different.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

1. **Abuse of Power**  Lets just begin with this specific point: Abuse of Power is not a crime.  Its an accusation, but its such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but dont have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  Its actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, theyre attempting to make anything that they dont like about any future presidents actions an abuse of power.  Who decides what abuse of power is?  Since its not legally defined, its literally nothing more than the opposition partys definition of what counts.  But attempting to use this as a charge, Democrats are setting up every president moving forward under the constant cloud of impeachment.

2. **Obstruction of Congress**  Not only is this not a crime, its not even a thing.  It doesnt exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call Obstruction of Congress is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Heres how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didnt think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article Obstruction of Congress.

It is quite the shame that House Democrats are acting on such flimsy and indefensible attempts at charging the president, because instead of issuing false charges and letting them fail, which absolutely would have happened, they are offering charges which dont exist under the law, and are therefore undefinable.  If you were charged for committing a crime, but the prosecutor couldnt name an actual crime that could be found on the books, your case would be thrown out in a matter of minutes, and you would probably have a case to sue the prosecutor for false prosecution, and this is no different.

You dont have to be a Trump supporter to see that this is institutionalized railroading, and the consequences of even attempting them could be far reaching and dangerous to the country.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/e8xlli/reading_the_impeachment_charges_house_democrats/","self.Conservative","http://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/e8xlli/reading_the_impeachment_charges_house_democrats/?ref=search_posts"

Anyone who spends more than an instant looking at these can see that these are a complete sham.

Lets begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia  Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation  Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese we didnt have the goods on the president.  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldnt bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery  Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldnt bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldnt make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine  For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and its likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment charges.   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out werent complete.  Ive gone over that the header stating its not complete had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators and transcribers ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.
