Verifying the assertion would take most of a block's worth of gas, but that doesn't matter much because fraud proof execution is an exceptional case anyway. If you take the multi-round approach (""I claim that you made a mistake between step 5000 and step 6000, you provide intermediate state roots for steps 5100, 5200.... 5900, I claim you made a mistake between step 5300 and step 5400...."") then you do need to keep track of a tree of chains that are each conditional on the outcome of disputes in progress.",1

To those who are already in the community and have deep memories of the horrible crimes of Bubbylon, this sounds persuasive. However, to anyone coming in from the outside, there is no reason presented why they should care about this faraway struggle, instead of dealing with much more important issues closer to home, like making sure that the Good Guys"" and not the Bad Guys"" win the 2020 US presidential election or convincing their friends who was right and who was wrong in Celebrity Charlie's recent sex scandal. Sure, team Ababulguk may well be morally better than team Bubbylon, but there's thousands of other teams out there who are also pretty morally decent, and who have a much healthier ratio of doing to complaining.

I was told by someone recently that Bitcoin Cash may well do better if it just rebrands itself to Bcash (or some other name) to make a clean break from its history and charts its own path forward; at first I resisted but I am increasingly seeing the wisdom of this perspective.",7

If you add a vote-saving mechanism to regular voting, what you get is an equilibrium where people *only* use their votes on the issues that they care about very strongly, with no incentive to make any votes on issues you care slightly or moderately about. This pushes things way too far in the other direction from one-person-one-vote, and makes *all* votes decided by the most extreme. Neither extreme is healthy; quadratic voting is the compromise between the two.

\&gt; And please don't tell me the answer is some kind of ""KYC"" process...

Yeah, the answer is some kind of identity system, though it does not need to be state-backed. See [https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/04/03/collusion.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/04/03/collusion.html) for why this is unfortunately unavoidable in any system that tries to fund public goods.",4

"28","2019-10-24 02:38",10,"Weekly Discussion &amp; Updates Oct. 21 - Oct. 27","eos","http://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/dkzlmk/weekly_discussion_updates_oct_21_oct_27/f4yixn8/","I read through the EOS New York proposal for governance and got some demand for people on the internet asking for my thoughts on it. First of all, though I continue to think that DPOS is plutocratic and generally not well-designed as a governance mechanism and its recent failures are predictable, I'm happy that there's a community here that cares about governance issues and is trying to do something different and innovate.

Going through [the document](https://medium.com/eos-new-york/uniting-stake-holder-incentives-to-maximize-decentralization-performance-530af1560401) bit by bit:

&gt; About voting: 1 token 30 votes is changed to 1 token 1 divisible vote where each additional block producer voted for further divides the total vote weight rather than multiplying it. Coordination of votes between large stake-holders is no longer possible. The ability to vote oneself into a BP spot with a large enough stake remains.

This is definitely a significant improvement and seems to successfully remove the possibility of very wealthy individuals or cartels getting quadratic returns by voting for themselves and each other.

&gt; We propose to remove the 1% inflation awarded to Block Producers entirely

Yay! This removes the ""special plutocrat interest rate"" that exists because very wealthy holders can vote themselves into power and then get coins by voting for themselves whereas ordinary holders cannot do this.

However, note that this negates one of the more exciting things that EOS was attempting to do, which was to use delegate positions to choose not just who runs the consensus but also who gets rewards of which they are expected to put a portion into providing the community with public goods. Of course, the [recent coindesk article](https://www.coindesk.com/everyones-worst-fears-about-eos-are-proving-true) describes this attempt as a complete failure (""as previously reported, the proposal system had been a way to fund dapp development on EOS (as well as community functions, lobbying costs and security audits), but without a way to agree on how to distribute the funds, they just accumulated"") and if the EOS community agrees that it's a failure then it should of course be shut down, but it would be nice to see some kind of new and better attempt at public goods incentivization.

&gt; A vote for a block producer is now a diversion of 50% of the inflation that a token-holder would otherwise receive into a pool that is distributed to Block Producers based on their rank. At a high level, inflation is now a voluntary thing rather than something that is forced upon a user.

So basically vote by donating? The problem with this that I see is that paying for security is a public good, and so one can expect it to be highly underfunded. Even today voter participation is low, and if votes are costly I can see it becoming miniscule. At that point an attacker could easily throw in a relatively small number of coins to take over the chain (and at low cost, as the votes would largely get paid right back to the attacker).

&gt; The VIP is the minimum amount of votes that must be cast before staking rewards are turned on and awarded to token holders. If total votes fall below this threshold then only block producers receive rewards .... If too few tokens vote then staking rewards are shut off, total inflation reduces, and 100% of inflation is now awarded to BPs until such time as the voting threshold is met again.

Is the idea here to make voting zero-cost (because there's no inflation to sacrifice) in the case that voter participation is too low? If so, that does solve the above problem, but now note that you've brought back the old plutocratic rich-people-vote-for-themselves regime.

Personally, I would say that if you're going down this path, then you may as well do one of two things: (i) move toward a more incentive-based PoS model a la Casper, which can still have delegation but where validator incentives are much more explicit (the pay-for-uptime in this proposal is a great start, but you'd also want to add slashing etc etc) and if you delegate to someone you inherit any rewards _and penalties_ that they incur, or (ii) properly integrate some community-based identity model and collusion resistance and much more thoroughly use these tools to make game-theoretically-sound governance and public goods funding infrastructure.",4

The whole point about a vote being worthless is to ensure that someone with decent financial means can't buy the results.

But even in a 1-person-1-vote scheme, vote-buying is a profitable enterprise if you care about the outcome! In 1P1V, a vote is _costless_, not worthless; it's worth quite a lot to anyone who can influence it. So I actually think QV improves things in this regard.

&gt; Quadratic voting still tilts the issue in favor of the whales \[edit:  although it is reduced versus e.g. linear weighting

It's reduced a really huge amount. For example someone with 1000000 times more money would have only 1000 times more voting power (1000 is 99.9% less than 1000000). In any real-world system, someone with 1000000 times more money would prefer influencing the outcome via side channels (lobbying, media influence, etc) anyway, and almost certainly have more than 1000 times the impact of a single regular person, regardless of whether QV or linear voting is used. And if you've made a formal system sufficiently fair that all the whales' optimal strategy is to go outside the system, you've pretty much made it as fair as you can; the only way to get additional fairness would be to fix whatever other systems the whales are influencing.

And at smaller scales than a 1000x disparity, it's also a very big impact. For example if you take the [US income distribution](https://dqydj.com/united-states-household-income-brackets-percentiles/), you get a Gini coefficient of ~0.45, but if you run the same calculation with square roots of incomes you get ~0.25, more equal than Denmark.

The reason I think QV-like schemes can improve fairness of society altogether is that because they're superior to existing voting schemes efficiency-wise it starts to make sense to deploy them in more contexts, which would on the whole make more parts of society more democratic.",4

&gt; What I know for sure is that 72 Million Eth were premined, that's over 67% of all existing Eth. I have not yet found any verifiable accounting of exactly how much was sold, and how much was kept. Can the community safely assume without a reasonable doubt that Vitalik doesn't own 16 million Eth or some other very large amount of Eth?

This is why I think it's inaccurate to say 72 million coins were premined. 12 million were premined (if you want to include coins reallocated during the DAO fork, which I think is fair, that goes up to 15.5 million, fine), 60 million coins were _sold_. That is to say, the coins were ""mined"" through an open process that was heavily marketed for months that anyone could participate in, where _the mining algorithm was sending BTC to an address controlled by the Ethereum Foundation_. The fact that the mining algorithm is explicitly designed to benefit a specific party to fund development (as opposed to unintentionally designed to benefit a few chip-making companies) doesn't change the premise here.

Now technically, it's possible that some single person was responsible for half of all purchases of ETH during the sale, but it's also possible that someone was responsible for half of all mining of BTC in 2009-2013. You could argue that EF insiders had an advantage because they could have colluded with EF to embezzle their BTC back, but the EF had a lot of people involved, as been under audit scrutiny, etc etc, so accomplishing such a thing on a nontrivial scale without getting caught would have been exceedingly difficult.",9

What do you mean by ""monolithic security model""? The ""either the whole thing sticks together or it breaks"" approach? That's unfortunately necessary IMO to keep the mental abstraction tractable. And I don't think the trilemma is a dealbreaker, sharding works around it effectively.

Huh? There's plenty of variables that are left to the market. The ones that aren't are typically that way because they deal with tradeoffs in public goods, which markets are not good at (though sometimes you can convert public goods into private goods, eg. via a ""users store their own winesses"" approach to storage; we are doing more of that in phase 2).",8

I don't know enough about government records to be able to tell. Questions I'd want answers to include:

* How much data in bytes per year is there?
* To what extent is that number inflated because people don't use efficient formats (eg. saving PDFs of screenshots of text instead of just saving the text)?
* Do we want the data completely public, or semi-public in the ""you can access a specific piece if you go ask for it, but you can't get a dump of the whole thing"" style?

\&gt; Do you think it would make sense for the Ethereum Foundation to  incorporate something like this into its own accounting procedures?

It sort of almost does; you can track payments from the EF main address ([https://etherscan.io/address/0xde0b295669a9fd93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae#internaltx](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde0b295669a9fd93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae#internaltx)) and main forwarding address ([https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ed8cee6b63b1c6afce3ad7c92f4fd7e1b8fad9f](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ed8cee6b63b1c6afce3ad7c92f4fd7e1b8fad9f)) to see what sub-accounts things are going to, though we haven't explicitly published what they represent. It's definitely something EF could try to do more of in the future if desired.

\&gt; Is this related exclusively to internet sales &amp; the requirement of online vendors to collect information about where their customers live?  
No, this is basically the idea that you can use ZK tech (combined with random audits) to verify that someone is paying sales tax (and potentially other legal requirements) while at the same time retaining full cypherpunk-level financial privacy/anonymity.

\&gt; For now, do you think using the methods you referenced to perform the functions of something like [https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/) would be appropriate?

I think petitions are the best place to start, as nothing goes *really* wrong if the system gets hacked. I think it can definitely be made at least secure enough for that. I expect a proper rollout will reveal a lot about its viability for anything larger-scale. Another alternative is a small town. 

\&gt; However, Im curious, what blockchain applications do you think would benefit most from this?

1. As an identity system for anything that legally requires it (eg. doing ICOs without going through a centralized intermediary)
2. Applications that require a unique identity system for economic reasons (eg. quadratic voting)

\&gt; 7.) Does the Ethereum Foundation have any plans to formally reach out to  &amp; educate political candidates on any of this stuff?

I personally have talked to governments about some of these things before! EF doesn't really have a \*standardized\* program of talking to governments beyond ""me and other core EF people fly out and see people from time to time"", though I could see it being in the future remit of an expanded/improved EF/EEA.

\&gt; Do you think it would make sense to also require something like [https://opencerts.io/](https://opencerts.io/) for financial/asset management purposes?

I wrote an article about this fundamental tradeoff here: [https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735)

We managed to get a couple orders of magnitude more favorable tradeoff curve than other projects through BLS signature aggregation, which reduces the marginal cost of a signature to 1 bit of data and 1 ECADD (\~0.001 traditional signature verifications) of computation.",18

In practice, this will mean that we would need to have a hard fork on the eth1 side to rebalance some gas costs (opcodes that read storage or read accounts would see their gas costs increased to 2000-10000), and after that at some point there will be a ""flag block height"" from which the eth1 state root will be moved into the eth2 system (or possibly some one-time processing will be run on the eth1 state to make some optimizations, eg. replacing the patricia hex trie with a binary tree) and after that eth1 will be part of eth2, with applications being able to run as before.

I do think the likely gas cost increase of storage/account reading opcodes (basically the same opcodes whose gas costs were already [increased in Tangerine Whistle](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-150.md); those costs will need to go up at least another order of magnitude) is something that contract devs should be aware and plan for. The reason that change will be necessary is that those opcodes greatly increase the size of a Merkle proof needed to [statelessly verify](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-stateless-client-concept/172) a block, so currently Merkle proofs for a worst-case block are &gt;100 MB; with those gas repricings plus trie optimization plus charging per byte of any contract being read, we could get it down to acceptable levels.",36

The current plan is that eth1 will be folded into eth2 as an execution environment via the stateless client approach, in which case, yes, contracts will keep working as expected.",16

For me personally, the ideal would be to have no single client exceed 1/3 of the network, so any software bug in any single client would not stop the network. Though having no single client exceed 1/2 is ok too and gets us most of the same benefit (if a major client has a bug, having no finality for a while while things are being figured out may even be an improvement...)

I expect a power law distribution, and it's definitely likely that some of the clients will not survive to see significant usage on mainnet.",45

Yep! And I expect they wouldn't lose their stake if it's just an unavailable chunk; they could publish all the data one second after it gets rejected and claim it was network latency. It may well could have been, so you can't punish too harshly in such a scenario.

Unavailable blocks also have the issue that a ""challenge"" is just an index, and so anyone can create challenges and you can't prove that any challenge is fake, so you'd need to have some kind of economic mechanism for getting around the fisherman's dilemma.... I haven't seen something that's not exploitable that's not committee-driven.",10
